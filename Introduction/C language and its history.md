## C language and its history

C language is a high-level programming language that was originally developed in the early 1970s by `Dennis Ritchie` at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs). C was designed to be a general-purpose language that could be used for a wide range of programming tasks, including system programming, application programming, and web development.

C language quickly gained popularity due to its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. Its popularity grew even further in the 1980s with the development of the UNIX operating system, which was written entirely in C.

Over the years, C has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, and it has been used to develop everything from operating systems to mobile applications. Many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python, have been influenced by C and share some of its syntax and conventions.

Despite the emergence of newer programming languages, C remains an important language for computer science students to learn, as it provides a solid foundation for understanding how computer programs work and how to write efficient and effective code.



## Why C is still relevant

C language is a powerful and versatile programming language that remains relevant today due to its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. 

* __Efficiency__:
  
  C language is a low-level language that provides direct access to hardware and system resources, making it ideal for system programming and embedded       systems development. It allows developers to write code that executes quickly and with minimal memory usage.

* __Portability__: 

  C language is highly portable and can be used on a wide range of hardware platforms and operating systems. This makes it an ideal language for developing   cross-platform applications and software libraries that can be used across different systems and devices.

* __Flexibility__: 

  C language is a general-purpose language that can be used for a wide range of programming tasks, including system programming, application programming,     and web development. It provides a wide range of data types, operators, and control structures, giving developers the flexibility to write code for         different applications and use cases.

* __Legacy code__: 

  Many legacy systems and applications are still written in C language, and as a result, there is still a high demand for C developers who can maintain and   update these systems. In addition, many modern systems and applications continue to use C or are built on top of existing C code, making it an essential   language for software development.

* __Learning C improves understanding of programming concepts__: 

  Because C is a low-level language, learning it can help developers understand how computers work at a more fundamental level. It provides a foundation     for understanding concepts such as memory management, pointers, and algorithms, which are important for developing efficient and effective code in other   languages as well.



## Why learn C

Learning C programming language is essential for several reasons. 

Firstly, C is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, making it a valuable skill for various industries such as software development, gaming, embedded systems, and operating systems. 

Secondly, learning C provides a strong understanding of computer programming principles, including memory management, data types, and syntax, which are fundamental concepts that apply to many programming languages. 

Thirdly, C is a low-level language, which means it gives programmers more control over the hardware, making it ideal for developing system software and device drivers. Finally, learning C can also improve problem-solving skills and logical thinking abilities, which are valuable traits for any programmer.
